## Literate programming in ConTeXt

To communicate intent, understanding as well as computation, we need the 
ability to typeset computational fragments inside an on going discussion in 
a given natural human language. We must also be able to capture these 
computational fragments and commit them to disk files in a structure which 
the compiler of one or more programming languages can turn these 
computational fragments into executable code. This *is* [Donald Knuth's 
vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) and TeX and its 
corresponding WEB literate programming system was the original 
implementation of this vision.

ConTeXt provides a very much more modern tool in which to implement 
literate programming.
